## TODO

- [x] Have a look at GatsbyJS and other static site generators
- [x] Re-familiarize myself with codingwithjesse.com code

## Notes

- Static site generators
    - https://www.staticgen.com/

    - Lannonbr: What if you make a CLI tool to pull content from framework sites to extract the buzzwords and then sort them

    - Seems like all static site generators replace the need for dev server & webpack etc.

    - Hexo
        - https://hexo.io/
        - Seems focused on non-programmer audience
        - Basically markdown-to-HTML conversion system
        - Lannonbr: More accessible for content writers rather than devs

    - GitBook
        - https://www.gitbook.com/
        - Seems focused on documentation generation, like JavaDoc maybe?

    - GatsbyJS
        - https://www.gatsbyjs.org/
        - Used with React components (only?)
        - Quick Start:
            npx gatsby gatsby-test
        - Gatsby keeps all the JavaScript, even for stateless React components
        - Doesn't seem to be possible to add to existing application

    
    - react-helmet
        - https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet
        - output meta and title (etc) tags for the <head>

    - Prepack
        - https://prepack.io/
        - A type of minifier
        - executes JavaScript to output super simplified data structures

    - React Static
        - https://github.com/nozzle/react-static
        - Seems great?

    - Is static site generation superior to an nginx cache layer on top of node.js?
        - There are benefits to having static files that can be hosted on a CDN
